🌟 LLM Powered Multilingual Voice Assistant for Multimodal Data 🌟


Welcome to a new era of AI-powered communication! This project is more than a voice assistant—it's your multilingual, multimodal companion that understands text, speech, and even images. Built with state-of-the-art AI models and optimized for real-time performance, this assistant speaks your language and adapts to your needs.

🚀 What Can It Do?

1. Speak and Understand Any Language
Ask a question in Hindi, get the answer in Hindi.
Speak in Mandarin, hear the response in Mandarin.

2. See and Process Images
Upload an image, and it extracts and interprets the text or context.
Example: Upload a restaurant menu and ask, "What are the vegetarian options?"
🌏 Supports any language you can think of!

3. See and Process Images
Upload an image, and it extracts and interprets the text or context.
Example: Upload a restaurant menu and ask, "What are the vegetarian options?"

4. Intelligent and Contextual Responses
Ask anything, and it gives meaningful answers using the Llava 1.5 7B model for multimodal data understanding.

5. Multimodal Magic
Combines speech, text, and images for a seamless user experience.

6. Natural and Clear Voices
Responds with realistic, natural-sounding voices using gTTS, maintaining the same language and tone as the query.

"What are the ingredients?"
The assistant extracts and explains!


🛠️ Hobby Project or Business MVP
Build and demo your very own assistant for business solutions, accessibility, or education.

Output Generation

Speech-to-Text Conversion:
The user's speech is accurately transcribed into text in the same language using Whisper.

Response Generation:
Based on the input, the assistant uses the Llava 1.5 7B model to generate intelligent and contextually relevant responses.

Text-to-Speech Output:
The response text is converted into spoken output using gTTS, maintaining the language and tone of the original query.
Example: If the user asked a question in Spanish, the response is also spoken in Spanish with proper pronunciation.If it has any fallback then it answers in english

🚀 Getting Started
